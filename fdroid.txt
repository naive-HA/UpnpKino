Commit Hash: The commit field still has the placeholder "your_commit_hash_here". You need to replace this with the actual Git commit hash that corresponds to your v1.0 release.
You can get the correct commit hash by running the following command in your project's root directory in the terminal: git rev-parse HEAD

What's Next?
Once you've corrected the signing key format and the commit hash in your YAML file:
1.
Commit and Push: Commit the final changes to your acab.naiveha.upnpkino.yml file.
2.
Tag your Release: Ensure you have a Git tag (e.g., v1.0) on the commit you specified. If you haven't tagged it yet, you can do so with git tag v1.0 <commit-hash>.
3.
Push to GitHub: Push your latest commits and the new tag to your GitHub repository (git push origin main --tags).
4.
Submit to F-Droid: With your repository prepared, you are ready to request your app's inclusion. Go to the F-Droid RFP (Requests for Packaging) repository and create a new issue. The bot will guide you through the process.
